# 👋 Hi, I’m @MaksymCheremisin

- 👀 I’m interested in Software Testing, playing guitar, reading books, and listening to music.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Software Testing Automation, Web Development and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job where I can implement and enhance my technical skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maksymcheremisin/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My guitar is older than my laptop, but both require regular "testing". I also love finding bugs, not only in code but also in recipes when I'm cooking dinner.
